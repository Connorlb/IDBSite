### Self-Critique
**What did we do well?**
1. Our information is presented pretty well. It's easy to read and not overwhelming.
2. Our website looks great on mobile.
3. Our API works reliably, and the formatting of our data in our database is solid.
4. Our color scheme looks great.
---
**What did we learn?**
1. We learned a lot about managing a database, including simple things like formatting the contents of a column.
2. We learned how to create an API for a postgres database.
3. We learned how to communicate with APIs and how to automate API calls.
4. We learned how to communicate with a SQL database using Python.
---
**What can we do better?**
1. Our google maps links lack accuracy, which needs to be improved for locating restaurants.
2. Our search function is pretty specific and lacks some functionality.
3. Our home page doesn't have anything interesting on it other than the carousel.
4. Our ingredients images are low quality, which could be improved.
---
**What puzzles us?**
1. We would like to be able to work with multiple concurrent filters.
2. Properly working with google-map-react is very difficult and we never totally figured it out.
3. Working with npm packages can be tricky and we still haven't totally mastered it.
4. We never learned how to have a nice loading animation.
---
### Other Critique
**What did they do well?**
1. The Slackers did a good job with their grid pages. Information is presented clearly, and the pages look great.
2. Detailed information is presented well in a box on the model pages.
3. The home page has some interesting links on it, and is presented well.
4. The search functionality works extremely well.
---
**What did we learn from their website?**
1. Filtering by sliders is a very interesting idea that we hadn't thought of.
2. Good background image choices mean a lot for the overall aesthetic of the website.
3. We got a few ideas about how to format our API documentation from theirs.
4. We learned that cards are a great way to present information cleanly.
---
**What can they do better?**
1. The links to google maps on the criminals model pages seem broken. They all link to the same place on the map regardless of the location of the criminals' crimes.
2. Changing pages will not refresh model images right away, which can cause confusion.
3. Grid images get stretched to fit. This can look pretty weird at times, and it may be better to just crop the images.
---
**What puzzles us about their website?**
Nothing really puzzled us about their site. Everything is presented very cleanly, it is easy to understand what is going on and what they were looking to accomplish
