PocketChef's API is designed to allow develoapers to access the information we provide in a format more friendly to development than what you'll find online. API calls are documented under Ingredients, Recipes, and Restaurants. All API calls return information in an easy-to-access JSON format, with calls that return multiple results (get all calls) returning JSON data with individual restaurant, recipe, and ingredients in the same format.

Our API Documentation can be found here: https://pdalisay.gitbooks.io/pocketchef-api/content/
