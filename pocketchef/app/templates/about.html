        <h1>About</h1>
		<p>PocketChef is a website designed to help you decide whether or not you want to eat in and cook for yourself or go out and buy food at a restaurant. You can check different restaurants and their menus to see if you're willing to buy that one food you've been craving. If that's too expensive for you, maybe you can go out and buy some ingredients for a cheaper alternative. We'll supply the recipes and the ingredients with the prices for each ingredient. Our goal is to help you make smart decisions with your wallet, while satisfying all your crvings.</p>
